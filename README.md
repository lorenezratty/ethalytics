# Welcome to Ethalytics

## What is Ethalytics?
Ethalytics is an open source dbt project used to run analytics against the Ethereum blockchain. I've put together models of Google BigQuery public data so you can jump right in, build the project to a BigQuery warehouse and run analytics.

## How to use Ethalytics
Using Ethalytics is quite easy. In order to run this dbt project you should be familiar with Google BigQuery, and dbt.

If you know how to use dbt, simply clone or fork this repo, wire yourself into a new schema on your BigQuery instance and you can build right away. These models consider using the `crypto_ethereum` public dataset.
